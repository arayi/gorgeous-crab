## Description

Make a single-page web and mobile responsive word game that allows users to choose a language and a difficulty level from easy (4 letters) to hard (any dictionary word).

Per game session, the user will attempt three words one by one. During the game, they will be able to click a button to re-scramble the current word, which will be animated via CSS. The user will have unlimited tries to unscramble each word, but can dismiss a word and get a new one unlimited times.

The user will be notified if their guess is correct or incorrect. Once the user unscrambles all three words, they will be notified that they have won with a dismissable modal.

The only libraries used to construct this will be for i18n.

## Context

This goal is important since we need to go ahead and continue our use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript!

Make sure to look at templates if you need to, but you should create the code from scratch.
